## What is R? 

* Widely used data science software
* Used by millions of data scientists, statisticians and analysts
* Most powerful statistical programming language
* Flexible, extensible and comprehensive for productivity
* Creates beautiful and unique data visualizations
* As seen in New York Times or The Economist
* Thriving open-source community 
* Leading edge of Statistics research

##  What aren’t you telling me about R?

* R is single-threaded 
* R is an in-memory application
* R is difficult to learn initially.
* And yet, major companies use R for production data science on large databases.
* Examples: 
    - [blog.revolutionanalytics.com/applications/]

##  Secrets to using R in production

* Don’t use R alone. 
    – Know what it’s good for! (And what it’s not good for.) 
    – Use R as part of a production stack 
* Use modern R workflows 
    – Be able to hire great data scientists
* Use R in conjunction with parallel/distributed data & compute architectures*

## Speeding up your R code 

* On a single machine
    - Vectorize
    - Use *data.table*
* Move to the cloud and parallelize
    - Easy to parallelize
    - Hard to parallelize

## Why cloud ?

* Get machines, storage and network as a service
    - From a single, persisent VM to a fully managed cluster
    - Let others care for maintenance, update, repairs
    - Virtually unlimited resources on demand
    - Pay only what you use
* Platforms:
    - [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/)
    - [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
    - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)

## Getting code into the cloud

* Docker images used to spawn nodes 
    – Default: rocker/tidyverse:latest
    – Lots of R packages pre-installed 
* But this cross-validation also needs: 
    – xgboost, e1071
* Easy fix: build your own docker image
    - write a Dockerfile that builds on an already existing Rocker image
    - add packages and applications
* Build Docker images in the cloud
    - 120 min free build time daily in GCP


## Getting data into the cloud

* Speed hierarchy
    - Superfast: In cloud, same region & zone
    - Fast: In cloud, different region or zone
    - Okay: Between different cloud platforms
    - Slow: Between cloud and your local machine
* Collect and keep the data in the cloud
    - Manage data downloads from within a VM instance
    - Check whether to keep data on persistent data storage


## Easy to parallelize 

* A problem is easy to speedup when: 
    - Calculating similar things many times 
    – Iterations in a loop, chunks of data, … 
    - Calculations are independent of each other
    - Each calculation takes a decent amount of time
* Just run multiple calculations in parallel on several machines
    - Easy to do with say 5-10 shards
    - With a 100+ shards, there are problems of load balancing, tasks dying etc.
    - Big cloud comapnies spend immense amount of engineering time to develop their
     cluster operating system

## Frameworks when it’s not easy to parallelize

* Use a framework
    - Flow processing frameworks  (e.g. Map-Reduce, Flume)
    - Query processing frameworks (e.g. BigQuery)
* Some frameworks can do both
* Apache Spark becomes increasingly popular as a general purpose framework

##  What is Apache Spark?

* Distributed cluster processing engine.
* Successor to Hadoop
* Store and analyze massive volumes in a robust, scalable cluster
* In-memory engine 100x faster than map-reduce
* Highly extensible, with machine-learning capabilities
* Supports Scala, Java, Python, R ...
* *Managed* cloud services available
    – GCP Dataproc
    - Azure Databricks
    - AWS EMR

## R and Spark: Sparklyr 

* sparklyr:
    - R interface to Spark
    – open-source R package from RStudio
* Move data between R and Spark
* Keeps *References* to Spark Data Frames
    – Familiar R operations, including dplyr syntax
    – Computations offloaded to Spark cluster, and deferred until needed
* CPU/RAM/Disk consumed in cluster, not by R
* Interfaces to Spark ML algorithms


## Things to note 

* All of the computation take place in the Spark cluster
    – Computations are delayed until you need results
    – Behind the scenes, Spark SQL statements are being written for you
* None of the data comes back to R
    – Until you call collect, when it becomes a tibble
     – It’s only at this point you have to worry about data size
* Use ordinary dplyr syntax to interact with data in Spark cluster


## Machine Learning with SparklyR 

```{R}
 TODO <- 2
```

* SparklyR provides R interfaces to Spark’s distributed machine learning algorithms (MLlib)
* Computations happing in the Spark cluster, not in R

## Packages to make R cloud-ready

* General
    - Tidyverse
    -  sparklyr
    - foreach, future
* Platform specific packages
    - Cloudyr: GCP, AWS
    - Azure

## Google Cloud Platform


## Packages

* Management of VMs
    - googleComputeEngineR
    - googleAuthR
* Managed frameworks
    - Dataproc 
    - Big Query
    - Big Table
    - Data flow
    - Cloud ML

## Big Query

* Sifting through terybytes of data
* Using SQL like syntax
* Super fast
* Limited expressiveness
* Fully managed, no need to specify cluster size
* Pay for data volume processed
* Ideal solution for preprocessing and condensing

## Data Flow

* GCP Dataflow (aka Flume)
* Most complicated option
    - Needs significant amount Java recoding for every new problem
    - Run FlumeJava with embedded Java-based R interpreter Renyin
* Might give highest computational throughput at given cost level

## Costs

* On most platforms, you pay
    - Compute resources by minute
        + Preemptive or spot instances can be much cheaper
    - Storage by size * duration
    - Queries by processed data volume
* Make sure
    - To check pricing, promos and free tier
    - To develop your approach on a smaller (but not too small) subset
    - Allocate only those resourced needed
    - Take down VMs, clusters after processing
    - Check for not longer needed storage
    - Set proper quotas
    - Preemptive or spot resources can be much cheaper
